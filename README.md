## Description
This project implements a recursive fractal image known as a pentaflake using the SFML library. The program allows users to specify the length of the pentagon's side (L) and the recursion depth (N) as command-line arguments. It displays the fractal in an SFML window, with the option to rotate the entire fractal and add multiple colors.

### Features
Recursive Fractal Drawing: The pentaflake is generated by recursively drawing smaller pentagons around a central pentagon. The depth of recursion is controlled by the N parameter.
The base pentagon's side length is specified by the L parameter, allowing for flexibility in the size of the fractal. The fractal can also be rotated by providing an optional third command line argument. Additionally, the fractal can be animated to rotate continuously. The pentagons are colored based on their position and recursion depth, creating a visually appealing pattern.

### Issues
One challenge was accurately positioning the smaller pentagons around the central pentagon using trigonometric functions. The geometric relationships between the pentagons were crucial and I had to make sure they touch but do not overlap. Implementing rotation for each pentagon around its center required careful use of the setOrigin() function in SFML. Managing transformations, including scaling and rotating, was quite tricky but taught me a lot about how SFML handles coordinate systems.
I also had an issue with the drivers on my machine where it could not handle deep levels of recursion well and only displayed a blank image, because of that I used an example with a low recursion depth for my screenshots.

### Extra Credit
I implemented a color scheme where pentagons change color based on their depth and position in the fractal. This creates an interesting and consistent pattern, which enhances the visual complexity of the fractal. I also added the ability to rotate the entire pentaflake using an optional command line argument.
